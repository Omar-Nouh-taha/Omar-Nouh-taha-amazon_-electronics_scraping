The bank itself kept two phones topped up during a weekend outing.

And when topping up my phone)   ( you can see the exact wattage going out of the power bank into the phone. The included USB C to USB C cable is a fast charging cable as well. I trust the Anker brand; their products have served me well over the years. This power bank will be coming with me on every outing where I won't be near an outlet.)   (This charger is heavier than it looks)   ( so maybe for some people it might not be as convenient. I have no issue with it. It's not in my pocket. That was my 'negative' for this product. Now to the good stuff. Oh it didn't come with a charger but it comes with a charging cable rated at 140W to match the power bank max output and input charging. I don't own any of those Apple products but I did charge someone's Iphone with it with their cord)   ( so I know it can charge Iphones if anyone is wondering. I really bought it thinking it would charge my son's laptop but it can't the port on his laptop doesn't allow charging)   ( just data transfer. It's a gaming laptop)   ( so even the Wattage was sufficient)   ( there was no way to charge it with this device. It does charge a laptop I have here that has the port that allows it)   ( as quickly as the laptop charger (that only outputs 45W) and yes the digital screen on the power bank shows it is outputting 45W to it. It will fluctuate between 42 to 46W but I think this is normal. When the laptop (or any other device connected to it) is fully charged)   ( it will stop. I should check to see if it will start to charge again if I start using the device connected to it. It probably will though)   ( this device kinda smart to check these things. It also allows you to charge devices while being charged. Maybe that is the new standard but not much power banks did that before)   ( so the fact that this one does it pretty cool. Back to the screen. It displays some nice information. It will give you an estimate how long the connected device will take to reach 100% in real time. It also does this when you are charging the bank itself. It tells you how long it will take for it to be fully charged. Yes it can do it simultaneously. So it can tell you how it will take to reach 100% and tell you how long devices connected will take to reach 100%. While being charged)   ( you can only charge two devices (USB A and USB C) because one of the ports (the main USB C) is both input and output. When it not being charged)   ( it can charge 3 devices at the same time. Remember thought that device output 140W max so it will adjust accordingly. I am able to charge my laptop (the 45W one))   ( my Samsung phone and some Bluetooth ear plugs (or another phone) all at once and it won't even run down the power bank. I don't use it daily)   ( so I haven't needed it to charge it too often but it doesn't take long to charge. I honestly much check how long but I haven't needed more than an hour so far.

This one has great heat management and it provides 1.1 charges to my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (i have tested the pack 5x already before making the review) keep in mind the testing has been with the wireless charging. If you go wired you will have better results.  Samsung phones (as of 2024) will not benefit from Qi2. So it will NOT get that fast 15W charge. Dont ask me why)   ( i dont know.

For my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra i have noticed its 1% for every 2% on the battery pack. So youll get a good full charge and have a little extra going wireless.  This is an awesome device with a great build)   ( if you find it on sale)   ( buy it. I bought mine from here from the used section. (Maybe a Samsung person returned it since it wont 15W charge).

(5000 lik pili 2 kez tam şarj ediyor (tabi oynamazsanız))   (ممتاز جداً يشحن الجوال 4 مرات)   (Update (12/2023): I have been using the power bank many times now and I can say it works very well and has been reliable. Since writing the original review I purchased and charged the power bank with a 65w USBC power adapter which supports the maximum 9v/2.77A charging of the Samsung power bank and can say it does charge noticeably faster. Seems to charge from 50% to 100% in roughly 1.5 hours. Either it is charging at maximum 2.77A or PPS (Samsung fast charge spec) because my 65w USBC power adapter supports both. Updated to 5/5 stars.  Additional update: ok I just read a review on another Anker USBC power bank)   ( and in that review it does say the first time you charge out of the box it charges slow. So maybe this is typical behaviour of fast charge power banks.  Original review:  The aesthetic and first impression of quality is good)   ( has a kind of recycled type plastic exterior case which is common these days. This does not mean it’s bad quality)   ( the recycled looking plastic with faint freckles still feels more rigid and tough in the hand than the plastic on my other power banks. Case is seamless and the curved bottom which makes the bottom a single piece of plastic I think makes the entire power bank much more rigid)   ( manufacturing quality and materials feel great. I like how the design is simple)   ( just one end has two USBC ports)   ( button and 4 indicator lights.  I am writing this review on the same day I got it delivered)   ( so I will edit and update with more impressions from extended use. But following this are some things I didn’t expect.  First of all manufacturing date on the box says 5/2023)   ( so it left the factory 5 months ago and the power bank charge was 0% (keep reading why I am quite confident this was the case). I didn’t expect 100% charge out of the box but maybe 30%? 40% at least for a recently manufactured product? anyway not a big deal just need to charge it up.  I read the user manual+box in full and always fully charge my battery products before attempting to use them. So after removing power bank from box I did not plug anything in or press the button. User manual says “only charge with included usbc cable” so I followed that instruction and used the short included cable to plug the power bank into 9v/2.22A (20W) USB power adapter (Samsung says maximum input charge rate is 9V/2.77A). The power bank then shows 1 of 4 lights blinking (first indication of near empty charge). Ok no problem shouldn’t take too long to charge i thought. With 20W power adapter this power bank took 4.5 hours to fully charge (I think it was quite clear to me the power bank was near 0%). I was checking regularly for the last 1 hour of charging because I thought it would finish charging at any moment)   ( but yeah waiting 4.5 hours is not the fast charging I expected. Ok I don’t expect to charge from 0% all the time)   ( but charging with 20W power adapter was slower than I thought.  For example I have a 10000mAh power bank from Anker it charges at a maximum of 5v/2.4A (12W) and it took 4.5 hours to charge from near empty to 100% (I measured this soon after purchasing it). Doesn’t make much sense does it? How can charging a power bank at 12W take the same amount of time as charging at 20W? I think the fast charging (20W) power bank should charge faster. The Anker also arrived empty and blinking 1/4 lights when started charging)   ( but it was manufactured 2 years before I bought it not 5 months before.  Anyhow not sure yet why this is the case)   ( maybe the Samsung power bank limits input charge rate on first charge. Or the Samsung ramps down charging speed much faster when the charge reaches over 75% to reduce battery temperature I don’t know. My expectations were around 3~3.5 hours to fully fast charge (20W) this power bank from 0100%. So with average use)   ( I thought I only have to wait 1.5 hours to fast charge it from 50100%. I will update this review if I experience any improvement.  4/5 stars because it’s aesthetic and feeling of good quality. It also technically “works” so can’t say it is useless either. But just not exactly what I expected. Edit this is my old initial rating. New rating is 5/5 as explained at top of review. Read more)   (Good),4.5 out of 5 stars,119 ratings,Unknown,power banks

(شركه غنيه بجودتها)   (The unit is obviously nice and good features.

Using this powerbank)   ( guess what he gets (with proper cable)....  Dun dun dun: 30W)   ( FAIL. So I returned it because it's expensive for 30W lol.  So I would suggest do a lot of research or test and return it)   ( because it's worth the time and money to get 120W+ charging from a power bank to your phone right (on the go that would be amazing).  It's something to do with the protocol like I thought his phone would do PD (USBC to USBC) would do 120W)   ( but it did 30W)   ( and you have no USBA for QC or whatever protocol his Redmi uses so we cannot test that.  I am assuming this is for proper PD compliant devices like Apple stuff and maybe even Samsung or other devices which already use C to C PD as their MAX wattage.  Anyway good luck!

The feature to charge it on a base is cool and probably worth if you own more than one. Can get warm when you discharging or charging but with acceptable levels. It got blocked once with the button getting unresponsive while it still had 23 percent left but got working after I tried to charge it. The only thing that does not worth is the asked price.

Having both an apple lightening and USBC cable integrated is perfect so I don't have to coil up additional cables  The cables store tight within the case and never flopped out on me.

Die Bedienung ist quasi selbsterklärend und das Display hell und super ablesbar. Gut finde ich auch)   ( dass man den Ladevorgang der Powerstation noch beschleunigen)   ( indem man sie zusätzlich zum mitgelieferten Steckernetzteil noch zusätzl. über den USB C Ein/Ausgang über ein weiteres Netzteil laden kann  ich habe dazu ein Nokia Steckernetzteil verwendet)   ( welches ich noch von einem älteren Nokia 7 plus habe  dies beschleunigt den Ladevorgang um ca. 30 min. Habe schon diverse Powerbanks)   ( Tablets und Handys mit der Powerstation geladen  funktioniert alles problemlos und im Display der Powerstation wird dann auch angezeigt)   ( wieviel Watt gerade gezogen werden und wie lange (in Stunden) der Akku der Powerstation bei dieser Belastung noch halten würde. Einziges Manko ist m.E.)   ( dass das mitgelieferte Steckernetzteil beim laden für meine Geschmack etwas zu warm wird)   ( aber dafür wird es ja wohl hoffentlich ausgelegt sein. Bin also alles in allem sehr zufrieden mit der Powerstation und habe auch div. weitere AnkerGeräte)   ( die mich bis jetzt nie im Stich gelassen haben. Read more)   (Hab das Gerät als BackupSpeicher für den Wechselrichter meiner PV Anlage gekauft)   ( damit im Falle eines Stromausfalls Spannung für den Wechselrichter verfügbar ist. Ist noch nicht zum Einsatz / Test gekommen. Ein wichtiger Grund für die Kaufentscheidung war auch das gleichzeitige Nachladen)   ( das dazu führt)   ( dass immer genug Reserve im kleinen Akku vorhanden ist. Im Grund wie bei einem Laptop)   ( was immer beim Netzbetrieb geladen wird.)   (Ich habe jetzt die Power Bank 521 schon etwas länger und auch voll im Einsatz.  Das heist gerade bei längeren Autofahrten von 23 oder auch über 6 std. Lädt sie Laptop oder für die Arbeit Makita Baustellen Akkus mit 5.0ah oder Stihl Akkus für Kettensägen.  Alles während sie im Kofferraum über den 12V mit 65 W selbst auf Lädt. Und geladen werden kann sie Fungiert so zu sagen dann als Puffer Speicher. Da bei kann man auch einen 3 fach Stecker verwenden.  So lange die gesamt Leistung die gebraucht wird unter 200 W bleibt ist das kein Problem. Wenn man deutlich darüber kommt also 235W lässt sie ohne weiteres noch laufen aber so bei 250W schaltet sie sich ab)   ( so dass man sie kurz von allem trennen muss)   ( auch vom Ladegerät. Danach wieder das Ladegerät anschließen und sie hat den jeweiligen Port wieder freigegeben.  Naja und sonnst allgemein im Haus reicht sie für einen großen Kühlschrank oder Fernseher aber halt der Größe entsprechend nicht all zu lange aber ausreichend für einen Strom Ausfall um 23 std. Etwas Zu überbrücken.  Ich bin mit dem Produkt sehr zufrieden)   ( habe aber auch Verbesserungen die ich gerne noch gehabt hätte.  Ein Fach oder eine Tasche die an der Powerbank ist)   ( für die Lande Kabel oder andere Kabel.  Für mich äußerst wichtig. Ich habe eine Tasche an den Griff befestigt. Für diese Dinge.  Spritz Wasser geschützt wäre auch schön.  Sonnst läuft das Gerät einwandfrei)   ( die Qualität ist auch entsprechend. Read more)   (Die Anker Powerstation PowerHouse 521 ist wie alle Produkte des Herstellers sehr gut verarbeitet und technisch hochwertig ausgestattet)   ( aber auch nicht ganz billig. Ich habe mich für die Anker Powerstation entschieden weil sie leicht und kompakt ist. Sie ist mit LFPAkkus ausgestattet)   ( was Robustheit und eine lange Lebensdauer verspricht. Das Display ist hervorragend und besitzt eine Restlaufanzeige. Man sollte sich darüber im Klaren sein)   ( dass sie nur eine Kapazität von 256Wh besitzt und eine Belastbarkeit von 200W aufweist. Wem diese Leistungsdaten genügen)   ( bekommt ein sehr hochwertiges Produkt)   ( was auch den Preis rechtfertigt. Ich benutze sie überwiegend um eine Kühlbox im Auto mit Strom zu versorgen)   ( auch wenn dieses abgestellt ist (z.B. in praller Sonne und befüllt mit Kühlgut) und selbst keinen Strom zur Verfügung stellen kann. Dafür muss man den ECOModus deaktivieren. Dieser Anwendungszweck hat sich schon sehr bewehrt. Zur Ladung der Powerstation über Solarstrom benutze ich die ebenfalls sehr kompakte und leichte 100W Solarzelle von Nicesolar)   ( ebenfalls über Amazon bezogen. Dazu gibt es eine separate Rezession von mir. Ich bin mit der Powerstation von Anker sehr zufrieden und kann sie uneingeschränkt empfehlen.)   (Kann ich jedem nur empfehlen)   ( der eine kleine)   ( handliche und kompakte Powerstation sucht)   ( für meine Verwendungszwecke wie ein Beamer draußen damit zu betreiben siehe andere Rezension von mir locker zwei Filme zum gucken… Genug Power)   ( um seine mobilen Geräte unterwegs oder beim Camping sorglos aufladen zu können),4.4 out of 5 stars,237 ratings,Anker,power banks

Let's just say I'm glad I'm on an iPhone)   ( because if I couldn't review some strange labels on images that show up as hints)   ( the app wouldn't do me any good and I'd have to receive help from alternate services to gain readings from the display. Hopefully the developers can work on this and it can be made more accessible to screen reader use)   ( not less)   ( perhaps with real UI buttons and proper labels on them)   ( and without these constant refreshes that make the screen reader return to the top of a page I'm on.  2. I would have liked to have some type of outlet covers or doors to go over the AC outlets and USB outputs when not in use. They could get a bit dusty inside if in an area prone to such a thing)   ( especially if I was to use it outside.  3. A case designed for the F1500 would be nice)   ( preferably one that can be rolled around while transporting it. It's moveable at 43 pounds)   ( but it's on the edge of being awkward to maneuver)   ( especially for longer distances than across a house or up and down stairs.  4. An expandable battery would be nice to have for this unit. Maybe one that can interface with the DC input on the back)   ( I'd take that if Anker came out with such a thing. Granted)   ( I wouldn't have integration like the C1000)   ( F2000)   ( and others have with their expantion batteries)   ( but given the low power consumption of the power station when it's only connected to Bluetooth or Wifi)   ( such a battery could easily connect to the app in that way if Anker came out with one.  All in all)   ( I'm glad I purchased this unit and I don't regret it in the least. Now I just need a power outage to test it in real world conditions... Or not. Read more)   (The Solix F1500 is an awesome solar generator. It is sized on the larger side right at the boundary of still being portable for extended camping adventures before you step up to the large RV/home backup units. That said)   ( I use it primarily as a home backup in case of power interruptions from the grid to keep my appliances running while using solar to keep the unit charged.  It offers a good compliment of ports and power options)   ( and I really like the clean design and solar capabilities specifically. 600 watts of solar input is enough to charge it to full in a few hours of direct sun with the right panels and have more than enough battery to last through the night powering key appliances.  Get this unit on sale and it is a solid bargain from a leading brand that backs the unit with a great warranty.),4.6 out of 5 stars,6 ratings,Anker,power banks

It can identify the wattage need for the specific device and deliver the maximum amount of wattage that devices can withstand. The crystal clear display shows your the three outputs and the wattage they are delivering. This is a truly super fast charger that can charge a laptop with enough juice to maintain current charge and slowly charge it to 100 percent. (This is my opinion based on heavy laptop use such as gaming)   ( and not low use such as documents and Excel). It charges your mobile device as fast as the charger that came in the box. (For modern users who haven't gotten a brick in the box with your phone)   ( it charges to max limit the battery your phone can withstand). The added app with Bluetooth can show you realtime information of charging status. It includes other very informative information such as amperage)   ( input power)   ( output power and battery cycle. It does get a tad warm upon charging multiple devices)   ( nothing I would consider a risk.  TWO MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS! Please read and consider!  First and probably most important. Not all USBCC cables are built the same. To benefit from this bank)   ( look for a cable that's rated up to a max of 240W. One is supplied in the box)   ( but it is short. Maybe a foot.  Second. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying the base that charges this and acts as a power supply for other devices. The base only supplies a max of 100W. Keep that in mind for multiple devices charging. ALSO there is NO pass through charging with the base through the bank to a device. Honestly you wouldn't need it. The bank charges the device from zero to 100 in under an hour)   ( and the bank actually puts out more (240w total).  Although both can be expensive)   ( individually and collectively)   ( if you are a person whom travels and needs a constant bank of power for multiple devices)   ( GET BOTH. The base charges the bank so fast! You will not be disappointed. Read more)   (Buy it)   (Unfortunately the product arrived unresponsive & not responding to any kind of charging)   ( or switching on)   ( or even trying to connect it to the app. It stated it was delivered live charged)   ( in fact it was delivered not working. I tried to charge it but nothing happened.  I contacted Amazon the same day that it was delivered (16/08/24) & it was a pain to get it returned. I had to print out a label & await Royal Mail collection which took until the 19th August. I'm writing this review as it's now the 22nd August & Amazon are still showing the product as not returned)   ( I haven't heard from Anker at all & quite frankly the returns process has put me off ordering another. I haven't received a refund yet either.)   (Quite big and heavy . Instructions are poor but easy to figure out after a short play . Can connect to an app but not necessary . I would have liked the display to stay on permanently but it doesn't. Seems well made and time will tell if it lasts.)   (nio issues)   ( should save us on a weekend camp. runs my MSI Gaming laptop as well)   ( so very impressive.),4.6 out of 5 stars,102 ratings,Anker,power banks

(I've had many portable chargers over the years)   ( this is the first with a digital display. It's nice that it tells me how long it will take to charge a device and the amount of charge left. I got the one without a cable as that seems unnecessary bc I always have cables with me and I've had those break before. The three ports are really helpful. It has usbc ports and 1 regular usb. I still have some of those cables for things. It charges up my iPhone in a couple of hours)   ( maybe a little less. It works for my iPad and even my MacBook Pro. That was one reason I got it. I don't plan on using it for my laptop regularly)   ( but in a pinch it charges it 25% which isn't bad for this sized battery. It is a little bulky)   ( but that's the price you pay for fast charging. If I'm walking I'll put it in my back pocket and my phone in the front. The other great thing is it charges up fast. With a 65W charger)   ( it will charge fully in about 2 hours. For the price you really can't do better than this.)   (It will completely charge an iPhone Pro Max 15 with about 3040% capacity left.  Tried it on a Samsung Chromebook 4 (running Manjaro) at 30% battery life left and charged up to about 84% before dying. So in a pinch)   ( it seems to be able to charge a laptop but it all depends on the laptop battery size.  It was able to output about 2829W during the process.  Haven't tried on windows laptop or Macbook yet (don't have one) so can't tell how well it will work. But at least on the Chromebook)   ( it seems to be working.  Small size and capacity. I would avoid the 5000mAh ones as they don't fully charge an iPhone 15 Pro Max from zero% while this one is more than capable. Won't get 2x charge but more like 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 times.)   (We took this to Europe and it was awesome! We used it daily on our phones and it never lost it’s charge (we charged it nightly). It’s a tad heavy)   ( but worth it. My daughter and I shared it she also had some that plugged directly in her phone without a cord)   ( but this one charged it so much better.)   (This device Anker 533 in the middle of the picture charges fairly well)   ( a lot better than the older Anker on the right of it and seems to have a better design as it doesn't scratch up the phone screen nearly as much if I have both in my pocket. It feels nice however there is a small issue with it)   ( it does remedy itself when discharged all the way to 0% and then back to full but it will sometimes drop to 99% without any load even after recharging to 100% so the battery gauge isn't particularly accurate and it'll stay at 0% for a good amount of time before it's actually dead sometimes upwards of 45 minutes depending what it's powering.),4.6 out of 5 stars,121 ratings,Anker,power banks

I've used several over the years but this one is the best)   ( hands down. When it got stolen along with my bag it was the first thing I replaced)   ( just to give context to how useful it is.  I have an iPhone 13 Pro and this battery pack can fully charge it 3 and a half times. If you only charge your phone to about 50%)   ( this batter pack can do that like 8 times over. Plus it's FAST. It really only takes about 15 minutes or so to get your battery from basically dead to a half charge. I like how there's a little screen where you can see the battery pack's exact battery percentage. Much better than the little 4 dots on most packs  The button on the side does feel a little cheap. In my experience with most battery packs)   ( the button is the first thing that breaks. My previous pack I used for over a year with no issue)   ( and my current one I've used for 4 months now)   ( still no issue. Hopefully it stays that way! But yes)   ( after using this battery pack)   ( there's no need to switch to any other.
